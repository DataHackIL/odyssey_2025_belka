## üß¨ BELKA-mini: Predict Small Molecule Binding

Welcome to the **BELKA-mini** challenge ‚Äî a scaled-down version of the [BELKA competition from NeurIPS 2024](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/leash-BELKA). In this hackathon-style challenge, your goal is to **predict whether a small molecule binds to a specific protein target** based on its SMILES representation.

This repo provides everything you need to get started.

## üéØ Challenge Overview

Given:
- A small molecule's **SMILES** string (representing its structure)
- The **protein target** name

Your task is to:
- Predict whether the molecule will **bind** to the target.

This is a **binary classification problem**. Binding is highly imbalanced (less than 1% of molecules bind), so careful modeling and evaluation are key!

---

## üî¨ Dataset Structure

Each row contains:
- `id`: unique identifier
- `buildingblock1/2/3_smiles`: SMILES for each component
- `molecule_smiles`: full molecule SMILES (including triazine core)
- `protein_name`: one of three targets (HSA, BRD4, sEH)
- `binds`: 1 if the molecule binds the protein, 0 otherwise
- `is_novel`: **(test only)** 1 if the molecule includes building blocks not seen in the training set

---

## üß™ Evaluation Metric

Submissions are scored using **average precision (AP)**.  
Final score = average AP **per protein + novelty group** (as in the original BELKA challenge).

---

## üöÄ How to Get Started

1. Open `starter_model.ipynb`
2. Run the featurization and baseline training
3. Submit predictions on the `test.csv` molecules

You‚Äôll be using:
- **ECFP fingerprints** (via RDKit)
- **Protein one-hot encoding**
- A simple **Random Forest**

This notebook is designed to work directly on Kaggle with no extra setup.

---

## üí° Hint Notebook (Advanced)

Once you‚Äôve got a baseline, check out `belka_hint_exploration.ipynb`:

- Analyze **class imbalance**
- Explore **novel vs. known** molecules
- Evaluate predictions **by protein or novelty**
- Learn how the **test set was constructed for generalization**

Use this notebook to improve how you evaluate and tune your models.

---

## üß† Tips for Participants

- The test set contains molecules from **new parts of chemical space**
- A good model should **generalize**, not just memorize
- Try:
  - Graph neural networks (GNNs)
  - 3D-aware models
  - Contrastive learning on SMILES
  - Pre-trained chemical embeddings (ChemBERTa, Mol2Vec)

## üì§ Submitting Predictions

Your submission should be a CSV with:
```
id,binds
123456789,0.013
123456790,0.872
...
```

Submit to the platform‚Äôs leaderboard for evaluation!
